# MusicWallpaperMac
A menu-bar app that automatically changes the desktop wallpaper based on the cover art of the current Apple Music song. Uses k-means clustering to find the most dominant color in the cover art and uses this info to generate an aestheically pleasing wallpaper. See screenshots below for examples. Once the app is running, changing songs on Apple Music should change the desktop wallpaper accordingly within 1-2 seconds. 

# Installation: 
Simply download and extract the MusicWallpaper.zip file from releases, or from the main branch. The MusicWallpaper.app file within can then be opened like any other app.

**Before opening, read the notes below:**

Upon running, you may be prompted by the alert that the app is damaged. This is because I can't pay for the $99 developer license from Apple, and so my app isn't notarized by them. There are two ways to get around this.

1. When opening the app for the first time, right-click the app, then hold option and press open instead of double tapping to open
2. Enter the command: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/.app" in your terminal. 

After the app opens succesfully, these steps are not required anymore, and the app can be opened normally. 

You can also build from scratch in case you don't want to do these steps. Details in the Building section below.

# Usage: 
After clicking on the app, a violin icon ðŸŽ» should appear in the menu bar. This indicates that the program is running. Changing the track on Apple Music shoud change the desktop wallpaper within 1-2 seconds. Click on the violin icon and press 'Quit' to stop the program.

# Building

Copy-paste the following commands into the terminal while in your directory of choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aaryaman-1409/MusicWallpaperMac/
cd MusicWallpaperMac/src
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this is done, to build into a portable .app copy-paste the following into terminal:

```
python3 setup.py py2app
open dist
```

The main.app file inside can then be moved around and run at any time. You can even delete the entire MusicWallpaperMac after the compilation, since the main.app file is entirely self-contained. 


If you don't want to build, you can also just directly run the script file by typing 
```python3 path/to/runner.py```
into the terminal.  It may take 10-15 secs for the program to resolve dependenices during the first run. On subsequent runs however, the program should start immediately.
